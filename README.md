Power BI Sales Performance Analysis - Data Transformation & Views
This project involves utilizing Power Query to transform, clean, and join multiple datasets, followed by creating key KPIs and views in Power BI for analyzing sales performance across regions, categories, and segments.

1. Data Transformation (Power Query)
Data Cleaning:
Handled missing/inconsistent data.
Removed duplicates and standardized formats.
Data Joining:
Joined datasets (Sales, Returns, Targets, Products, Customers, Regions, Salespersons) using key columns.
Calculated Columns:
Net Sales = Sales â€“ Returns
% Target Achieved = (Net Sales / Target Sales) * 100
Profit Margin = (Profit / Net Sales) * 100
What-If Discount: User input to calculate predicted profit % based on discount percentage per segment.
2. Key KPIs
Total Sales: Sum of Net Sales
% Target Achieved: Percentage of targets achieved for sales
Profit Margin: Profitability percentage calculated as (Profit / Sales Amount)
3. Views & Analysis
1. Sales Performance
Sub-Views:
Overall Sales Trends: Last 4 years' sales, with current year vs. last year comparison.
Segmented by: Sales split by segments, categories, regions.
2. Target/Benchmark Analysis
Highlight regions/states that achieved or missed their current year sales targets.
3. What-If Analysis
User inputs discount percentages for each segment to calculate predicted profit margin.
4. Pareto Analysis
Allows users to check what percentage of total sales is contributed by a chosen percentage of top customers.
Note: All data transformations and calculated columns were performed exclusively in Power Query.

Visualizations
KPI Cards: Displaying Total Sales, % Target Achieved, and Profit Margin.
Line Chart: 4-year trend comparison for overall sales.
Bar/Column Charts: Sales breakdown by segment, region, and category.
What-If Parameter: Interactive input for discount percentage with a resulting predicted profit chart.
