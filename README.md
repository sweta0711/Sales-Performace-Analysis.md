# **Sales Performance Analysis with Power BI**

This project analyzes sales data using Power BI, focusing on sales trends, target achievement, what-if discount scenarios, and Pareto analysis. Data transformation and cleaning were performed in Power Query to ensure accurate reporting.

## **Data Transformation & Cleaning:**
- Imported datasets: Sales, Returns, Targets, Products, Customers, Regions, Salespersons.
- Addressed missing/inconsistent data and standardized formats.
- Joined datasets using key columns.
- Created new columns using Power Query:
  - **Net Sales** = Sales – Returns
  - **% Target Achieved** = (Net Sales / Target Sales) * 100
  - **Profit Margin** = (Profit / Net Sales) * 100
  - **What-If Discount** = Allows user input for discount % to predict profit.
    
## **Key KPIs:**
- **Total Sales**: Net Sales
- **% Target Achieved**
- **Profit Margin**

## **Power BI Dashboard Views:**
1. **Sales Performance:**
   - Displays 4-year sales trends with year-over-year comparisons by segments, categories, and regions.
2. **Target/Benchmark Analysis:**
   - Highlights regions/states that have achieved or missed current year sales targets.
3. **What-If Analysis:**
   - Allows users to input discount percentages for segments and predict profits.
4. **Pareto Analysis:**
   - Helps users check the contribution of top customers to total sales.

This project provides a detailed view of sales performance with actionable insights on targets, trends, and customer contributions.
